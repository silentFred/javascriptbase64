This is a library that I created to facilitate screaming fast base64 encoding/decoding.  All the other libraries/scripts that I found out there were very slow in comparison.  My library is about 40% faster than anything I've ever found.  I use this in AJAX calls to decode base64 encoded information.

Please let me know what you think and feel free to report bugs and make suggestions to make it faster.

Tested in Safari 3, Firefox 2-3, IE 6-7
